# Assignment-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

The (redacted) .docx file included in this repo is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset which can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data), the online Machine Learning (ML) programming and survey publishing platform. The dataset regards The Titanic and Kaggle's competition is about using it, along with ML methods, to predict which passengers would survive the accident and which not.

Our assignment's tasks were to perform an EDA and evaluate four user-submitted solutions, based on which ML algorithm we would have used for our prediction. In case you are unfamiliar with what an EDA is and arrived here while trying to order pizza üçïüçï online (I swear I had nothing to do with it), it is an approach/procedure that allows data analysts to gain an understanding of the data they are working with. Additionally, thanks to the fact that it includes visualization and preprocessing of said data, it also assists them in analyzing it, drawing information from a database and deciding which ML algorithm/s will be the most efficient in predicting an outcome among others.

The code needed to visualize and (pre)process the data was written as a Jupyter/Python notebok, using Microsoft Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/), after being tested on Kaggle's online source code editor. We were not asked to run any ML learning algorithms to make an
actual prediction. I, also, did not submit my EDA on Kaggle.
